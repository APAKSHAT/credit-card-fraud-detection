# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project is about detecting credit card fraud using machine learning. The goal is to build a model that can tell whether a transaction is legit or fraudulent.

## About

I used a dataset from Kaggle with real credit card transactions. It includes both normal and fraud cases, which helps in training and testing different models.

I applied data preprocessing, feature engineering, and trained models like Random Forest and SVM to classify the transactions. The main focus was to improve accuracy and reduce false positives.

## Dataset

You can find the dataset here:  
ðŸ”— [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

Make sure to download `creditcard.csv` and place it in the same folder as the code files.

## How to Run

1. Download or clone the repo
2. Put the dataset (`creditcard.csv`) in the same folder
3. Run `card.py` to train the models and check results

## Libraries Used

- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
